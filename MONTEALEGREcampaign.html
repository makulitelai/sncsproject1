As of now, many parts of the Philippines are still recovering with the whole situation. Some started to evacuate
while others chose to stay in their homes. Many have lost their homes, belongings, and even their loved ones.
Because of this, many people decided to help. Imagine all those lives we have lost because of the typhoon. Imagine 
this might be you who need help. We are one country who help the lives of others because we are the only one
here for each other. ''bayanihan''.</p>
